## Summary
This project uses pixi.js to implement the front end of a 2D PvP Space Shooter Game, and uses websockets to allow communication between players via a backend server. The game has a start screen that shows instructions and allows a user to enter a player name, providing appropriate feedback if the input is inappropriate. A waiting message is displayed as the server waits for a second player to pair with, at that time a countdown is displayed then the players enter a match. Players use simple WASD and space keystrokes to increase and decrease velocity, and the mouse is used to point and shoot at the opponent. The game implements a scrolling background, asteroid obstacles in the foreground, healthbars, weapons powerups, and a particle effect for ship engines.
